### üåü Projects

- **[Amaze Voice Lab](https://github.com/mathusanMe/Amaze-Voice-Lab)** (Feb 2023 - April 2023)
  - Worked **under the guidance of a researcher-professor over three months**.
  - Implemented **Whisper ML model** for Automatic Speech Recognition **(ASR)**, resulting in a **30% increase** in **operational efficiency** and a **25% reduction** in **response latency**, while enhancing system reliability.
  - **Reduced processing time** for voice recognition by **84%** by integrating an optimised Whisper model instead of the base model.

- **[Advanced Job Control Shell Emulator](https://github.com/mathusanMe/Job-Control-Shell-Emulator)** (Nov 2023 - Jan 2024)
  - **Led a team** to design and develop a Linux-optimised shell emulator using C, meeting a critical milestone in just 4 weeks.
  - Leveraged a **75% improvement** in both **manageability and scalability** by restructuring and grouping related C files.
  - **Improved development workflow** by **25%** by implementing GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration (CI), enhancing code integration and testing efficiency.
  - **Accelerated deployment processes** by **20%** by leveraging Docker for Continuous Deployment (CD), ensuring rapid and reliable software delivery.
 
- **[Blur-Image](https://github.com/mathusanm6/Blur-Image)** (Feb 2024 - Jun 2024)
  - Worked **under the supervision of a researcher-professor in mathematics over three months** as part of a research project.
  - Implemented **Richardson-Lucy deconvolution algorithm** to sharpen images previously blurred by a predetermined kernel.
  - Implemented **Blind Richardson-Lucy deconvolution algorithm** to sharpen image previously blurred by an organic blur or an unknown kernel.

- **[Movie Recommendation System](https://github.com/mathusanMe/Movie-Recommendation-System)** (Feb 2024)
  - Developed a **movie recommendation system** utilizing user-item matrix and the KNN classifier.
  - Gained insights into recommender systems's implementation using Python

### üåê Additional Skills
- **Multilingual:** English (Fluent), French, Tamil (Native).
- **Interests:** [Competitive Programming](https://github.com/mathusanMe/LeetCode), Machine Learning, Distributed Systems, Abstract Mathematics, Game development.
